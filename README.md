CONTEXT  
This project is an evaluation assignment for the Customer Relationship Management class within the Master's program in Data Mining and Business Intelligence 2023-2024 at Complutense University of Madrid. The whole project is performed by a group of 4 students and this notebook is just a part of the analysis carried out in Python by one team member. This dataset was originally created to predict who will respond to a product or service offer. A response model can provide a significant boost to the efficiency of a marketing campaign by increasing responses or reducing expenditures. In our case, we are going to leverage this dataset to gain hidden insight of the customers.
